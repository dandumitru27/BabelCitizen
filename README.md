## Babel Citizen

A website for people who are learning a foreign language to help them discover new music in that language. They can watch a song's video and follow the lyrics and translation to learn new words and expressions.

It does that by having a list of songs by language and having for each song a page with the embedded YouTube video, some song details, and a link to see the lyrics and translation on lyricstranslate.com.

It's developed in .NET 5 (C#, ASP.NET Razor Pages, Entity Framework), using a SQL Server database.

It was developed fast as an MVP, put online on babelcitizen.com, but it's now discontinued as it did not get enough traction.
